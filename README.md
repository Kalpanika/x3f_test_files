X3F Sample Files

These files are samples used to test the conversion functions of the X3F Tools code.

Currently, there are two images in the library, both chosen for the broad range of 
colors and the lower noise of each image.  Later tests may require noisier images, 
and so subsequently more images may be added.

  - _SDI8040.X3F:  Merrill image that includes a rainbow
  - _SDI8284.X3F:  Quattro image that includes vegetables of various colors
